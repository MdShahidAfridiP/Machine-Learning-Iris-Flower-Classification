# Machine-Learning-Iris-Flower-Classification
Machine Learning Classification Model for classifying Flowers( setosa, versicolor, virginica)

To Built this model I have used a Packages like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib for data handling and visualization.
I have found that 'petal_width' and 'petal_length' are sufficient to built this model.
and Finally built this model with RandomForest Classifier to predict.
:) Also tried to predict with Logistic regression.

If I am Wrong please let me Know.... thankyou :)
